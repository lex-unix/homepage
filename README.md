## Personal homepage

This application is built with Next.js (`pages` router) and deployed to Vercel.
I'm using Sanity to publis my blog posts (which is a rare occasion).

### Future plans

This setup seems like an overkill for such a simple site. In the future, I plan to migrate this application to Astro as itâ€™s mostly static.
It would allow to use Astro's built-in content management and drop Sanity , which would eliminate quite a few dependencies I'm not eager to manage.
